# Debloat
Based on original work by Sycnex: https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater

Additions: Silent switches for individual windows 10 debloat options found in the interactive debloat utility. This should allow different MDT environments to utilize each option as requirements dictate. Each interaction has an optional command line replacement.
